<h1>The Colossus</h1> 
<h2>Sylvia Plath (1932-1963)</h2>

<p>
I shall never get you put together entirely,<br>
Pieced, glued, and properly jointed.<br>
Mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles<br>
Proceed from your great lips.<br>
Itâ€™s worse than a barnyard.<br>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,<br>
Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.<br>
Thirty years now I have labored<br>
To dredge the silt from your throat.<br>
I am none the wiser.<br>
</p>

<p>
Scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol<br>
I crawl like an ant in mourning<br>
Over the weedy acres of your brow<br>
To mend the immense skull plates and clear<br>
The bald, white tumuli of your eyes.<br>
</p>

<p>
A blue sky out of the Oresteia<br> <!-- The Oresteia is a trilogy of greek tragedies that follows the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra, the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes, and the haunting of Orestes by the Furies.  -->
Arches above us. O father, all by yourself<br>
You are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum.<br>
I open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.<br>
Your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered<br>
</p>

<p>
In their old anarchy to the horizon-line.<br>
It would take more than a lightning-stroke<br>
To create such a ruin.<br>
Nights, I squat in the cornucopia<br>
Of your left ear, out of the wind,<br>
</p>

<p>
Counting the red stars and those of plum-color.<br>
The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.<br>
My hours are married to shadow.<br>
No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel<br>
On the blank stones of the landing.<br>
